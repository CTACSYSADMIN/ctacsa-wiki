=================================================

Subject: Deque Information

Revision History:
    2015-03-02 09:52:41 - Version 1 created by Bao
    2017-01-16 9:44:51 - Version 1.b Updated for Deque 6.1.4
    2018-09-25 11:55:13 - Version 2 added LDAP settings info
 
Assets:
- hhs-deque-core-01.prod.hhs.local (m4.xlarge)
- hhs-deque-analysis-01.prod.hhs.local (m4.xlarge)
- RDS

UI Login
- hhs-deque-core-01.prod.hhs.local/auth
- hhs-deque-core-01.prod.hhs.local/worldspace (LDAP)

Current Deque version: 6.1.4

Prerequisites
- Packages that need to be installed on the core server: 
   supervisor
   rabbitmq
   After rabbitmq is installed, run the following commands (substitute the password as necessary)
      rabbitmqctl add_vhost /
      rabbitmqctl add_user dqadmin admin
      rabbitmqctl set_user_tags dqadmin administrator
      rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / dqadmin &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34;
   Redis
      Redis vulnerability:
        in /etc/redis/redis.conf, in the requirepass directive, add a password
        in Deque:
         cd /appdata/deque/mounts/config-server 
         vi application.yml
         in the redis section add the following:
               password: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; password from above &gt;&gt;&gt;
         
   Mongo
      in /etc/mongo.conf, ensure the following is enabled:
         security:  authorization: enabled
      Mongo password:
         mongodb://username:password@hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local:27018/deque
      Also need to run some mongo commands to create users and databases (be careful of the copy/paste of quotes/backticks)
         mongo admin --port 27018 --eval &#34;db.createUser({ user: &#39;mongodeque&#39;, pwd: &#39;Hw6wmaPF2jhqkWDob&#39;, roles: [ { role: &#39;dbOwner&#39;, db: &#39;admin&#39; } ] });&#34;
         mongo deque --port 27018 --eval &#34;db.createUser({ user: &#39;mongodeque&#39;, pwd: &#39;Hw6wmaPF2jhqkWDob&#39;, roles: [ { role: &#39;dbOwner&#39;, db: &#39;deque&#39; } ] });&#34;
         mongo deque-custom-rules --port 27018 --eval &#34;db.createUser({ user: &#39;mongodeque&#39;, pwd: &#39;Hw6wmaPF2jhqkWDob&#39;, roles: [ { role: &#39;dbOwner&#39;, db:&#39;deque-custom-rules&#39; } ] });&#34;


         ****** TO DO:::: - find out why mongo is not starting using the service. ******
- Packages that need to be installed on the analysis server
   supervisor
   Chrome
      wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
      echo &#34;deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main&#34; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
      apt-get update
      apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable
  XVFB
      apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev xvfb
      

- Ports that need to be open from analysis server to core server:
  5672 (rabbitmq)
   6379 (redis)
   8095 (deque application port)
   8761 (deque application port)
   15672 (rabbitmq admin)
   27018 (mongo make sure to point the datadir to /appdata/mongo)


- installer (this is the deque *.run file)
- RDS (if you go MySQL, make sure that you configure the datadir to /appdata/mysql)
    create 2 databases:
       wscomply
       wauth
    create 1 user with access to both databases

Send an email to: help@deque.com
Allowed users to contact Deque support: bnguyen, ktzeng, Alex(HHS), possibly 1 or 2 others.
In the email include
- description of the problem
- version of worldspace (currently 6.1.4
============================================================================================================

Normal order of start process:
- Core Server
  - WSWeb
  - WSAuth
  - WorldspaceComply
  (Pause and wait until UI is up)
  - BrowserHub
  - BrowserService
  To verify processes have started you can tail BrowserService.log and see where it says ‘connected to hub’
  - TaskProcessor
  Tail BrowserService.log and check for ‘firefox running’ message.
  - DocumentProcessor
  - LoadController
  - WSMgrService


============================================================================================================
Troubleshooting
============================================================================================================

If a user reports that the scans appear to be running but not ‘moving’:
Stop scanning services in the following order:
- LoadController
- TaskProcessor
- BrowserHub
- BrowserService

Then start scanning services in the following order:
- BrowserHub
- BrowserService
- TaskProcessor
- DocumentProcessor
- LoadController

- mongo disk space on hhs-deque-core-01.prod.hhs.local
  Mongo database only keeps cached data. This can be dropped at any time. Drop the database with the following command (can be cron&#39;d as necessary):
  /usr/bin/mongo deque --port 27018 --eval &#34;db.dropDatabase()&#34;

- logrotate for /appdata/deque/log
      in /appdata/deque/supervisord
      edit: comply.conf
      add:
         stdout_logfile_backups=x

      then run: (when you run the update command, there&#39;s a chance that it&#39;ll restart the services, so schedule accordingly)
         supervisorctl reread
         supervisorctl update


- uninstalling deque
   to uninstall deque go into cd /appdata/deque and run the uninstall script. THen remove the contents of /appdata/deque/*



- How to stop all running scans from the database
   1) MySQL queries
      DELETE FROM wscomply.work_queue_item;
      UPDATE wscomply.spider_job SET location = null, status = &#39;Completed&#39;;
      UPDATE wscomply.issue SET marked_for_deletion = 0;
   2) Rabbitmq
      Also need to clear the rabbitmq queues.
      - stop rabbitmq service (/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server stop)
      - remove contents of /appdata/rabbitmq/mnesia/&lt;hostname&gt;/
      - restart rabbitmq service
      - rerun the rabbitmqctl commands to create the user:
        rabbitmqctl add_user dqadmin deque &amp;&amp; rabbitmqctl set_user_tags dqadmin administrator &amp;&amp; rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / dqadmin &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34;
      - enable the plugins again
        sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

- Troubleshooting connections to Database
   The database connection strings are stored in 
      /appdata/deque/tmocat/comm/classes/WorldSpaceConfig.groovy
  

- Enabling debug:
  Change 2 files:
  /appdata/deque/mounts/config-server

- Enabling LDAP (ensuring LDAP is used)
  vi /appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/worldspace-core/production/application.yml
  Change:
    useldap=false
  to:
    useldap=true



- Assigning a user as an administrator
1. Connect to the worldspace mysql server, and select the appropriate database.
        use DATABASE_NAME;

Example:
   use wscomply;

2.Find the User ID of the user in question.
        select id,username,email from fireeyesuser whereemail=&#39;user_email@domain&#39;;

        +----+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
        | id   | username                   | email                           |
        +----+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
        |  7   |user_email@domain  |user_email@domain    |
        +----+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
            A sample user ID

3. Set the user as an administrator, where N in the following query is the user&#39;s ID.
        INSERT INTO role_people VALUES((SELECT id FROM role WHERE authority=&#39;ROLE_ADMIN&#39;), N);


- To remove admin privileges from a user, use
    UPDATE role_people SET role_id=(SELECT id FROM role WHERE authority=&#39;ROLE_USER&#39;) WHERE role_id = (select id from role where authority = &#39;ROLE_ADMIN&#39;) AND user_id=N;
- Mass add a user account to all projects as admin
   INSERT INTO fireeyesgroup_fireeyesuser (group_users_id, user_id) SELECT DISTINCT fg.id, (SELECT id FROM fireeyesuser WHERE email=&#39;email@domain&#39;) FROM fireeyesgroup fg WHERE fg.name=&#39;admins&#39;;

Updating DNS for Deque
- Keycloak 
In Keycloak, append DNS to comply section &gt; clients


- hhs-deque-core-01.prod.hhs.local
- in deque/common/classes directory
- Edit WorldSpace_config.groovy -&gt; confirm https &amp; URL change
- Edit keycloak.json file -&gt; confirm https://... URL
- deque/components/web/conf.d/*
remove deque-specific ssl cert references

- Mongo issues
   if mongo is failing tail the manager.log: /appdata/deque/logs/manager.log

Installation issues and workarounds
============================================================================================================
on analysis server, make sure the following is running:

/usr/bin/Xvfb :6 -ac -screen 0 1024x768x16 -fbdir /tmp/
/usr/bin/xterm -display :6 -e ./runBrowserService.sh

- On the analysis server, the installer expects that nginx be installed, even though it only runs on the core server. The directory for nginx may not exist. The installer will eventually timeout. It&#39;s probably a good idea to mkdir -p /etc/nginx as a blank directory. 

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
(Deprecated - Firefox is no longer used - chrome is the package that you want to install)
Firefox package version (dpkg -l | grep firefox)
- need to ensure version 45.5.1


============================================================================================================
The /appdata/deque/bin directory
============================================================================================================
This directory is, well, the bin directory.

db_upgrade.sh is often run after an install. 
first_run.sh is run only on a fresh install.


============================================================================================================
Overview of Installation
============================================================================================================


1) download the deque installer (both analysis and core server)
https://sftp.dequecloud.com/?u=SgNG&amp;p=y72f&amp;path=/comply.linux-6.1.4.run

2) mongo.conf (core server)
change bindIP to listen on 0.0.0.0
change dbPath....Note If you change this, be sure to make the directory
Changed default port from 27017 to 270178

3) redis.conf change bind value to IP or 0.0.0.0. (core server)

4) RabbitMQ  (core server)
enable plugins: rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
rabbitmqctl add_user {username} {password} &amp;&amp; rabbitmqctl set_user_tags {username} administrator &amp;&amp; rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / {username} &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34; &#34;.*&#34;

5) Chrome vs firefox (install chrome on the analysis server)
1.) Import the public key used by the package management system: wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
2.) Create the list file for RabbitMQ: echo &#34;deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main&#34; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
3.) Reload the local package database: sudo apt-get update
4.) Install the Google Chrome packages: sudo apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable

6) xvfb &amp; GTk3 (core &amp; analysis servers)
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev xvfb

7 set up the database cd /appdata/deque/bin/
./db_upgrade.sh

8. cd /appdata/deque/components/keycloak/standalone/configuration
vi standalone.xml
change &lt;connection-url&gt; to localhost &lt;/connection-url&gt;


9. cd /appdata/deque/components/bin
./firstrun.sh (only run on new installs)

CTRL+C to kill the script
this script creates tables and users in the auth database. It is only necessary to run once during the install.


10. cd /appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/worldspace-core/production/
vi application.yml file
This is the database connection string. change the jdbc hostname line to &#39;localhost&#39;

11. cd /appdata/deque/mounts/nginx/conf.d
vi comply.conf

in the serverline remove http://

restart nginx

12. chown worldspace:worldspace /appdata/deque -R


on the core server:
13. supervisorctl status
14. supervisorctl stop all
15. supervisorctl start scan-manager:ecp-registry &amp; tail /appdata/deque/logs/registry.log
16. supervisorctl start scan-manager:ecp-config-server &amp; tail /appdata/deque/logs/config-server.log
17. supervisorctl start scan-manager: &amp; tail /appdata/deque/logs/custom-rules.log
18. supervisorctl start worldspace: &amp; tail /appdata/deque/logs/keycloak.log
19. tail worldspace-core.log


on the analysis server
supervisorctl status
supervisorctl stop all
supervisorctl start scan-worker:

20. cd /appdata/deque/supervisord/ (on the analysis server)
vi comply.conf
--change autostart to false for the following: program:ecp-registry, and ecp-config-server----

[program:ecp-registry]
command=/appdata/deque/components/java/bin/java -jar /appdata/deque/components/comply/wars/registry-1.1.3.war -Xmx1024m -Xms256m -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom --spring.profiles.active=production -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError
directory=/appdata/deque
autostart=false

[program:ecp-config-server]
command=/appdata/deque/components/java/bin/java -jar /appdata/deque/components/comply/wars/config-server-1.1.3.war  -Xmx1024m -Xms256m -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom --eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local:8761/eureka --spring.profiles.active=native -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError
directory=/appdata/deque
autostart=false

21. supervisorctl start scan-worker: (on the analysis server)
22. tail -f /appdata/deque/logs/worker.log (and make sure there are no errors in the log)

23. UI Work
- load the core server in a browser (hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local/auth)
default user/password is admin/admin

go to Clients
go to Comply

in the Valid reirects URIs
remove anything with worlspace-core, localhost, 127., etc. should only have 2 urls with stage-deque1.cloud.hhs.gov, and then add URLs for FQDN of the core server(eg: http://hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local/*  and https://hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local/*)



===================
Troubleshooting why the DNS doens&#39;t load. Suspect something with the Apache reverse proxy but configuration works in prod 
===================
/appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/realm/worldspace-comply/master
change keycloak.json DNS to FQDN of the server

/appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/worldspace-core/production/
change application.yml DNS to FQDN of the server
feServerBaseUrl: http://hhs-deque-core-01.stg.hhs.local/worldspace

*** NOTE: Do not start the worldspace comply service until the config-server service has fully started


24. in the UI: log in with admin@deque.com, admin. 
go to system settings
go to organizations
create a test Organization

====================================================================================
troubleshooting nginx

/appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/worldspace-core/production/
vi application.xml
scroll to the bottom and change http://stage-deque1.cloud.hhs.gov to http://FQDN of the server
which didn&#39;t work
so we changed this line from 80 to 443 (ie https://stage-deque1.cloud.hhs.gov)


Add&#39;l troubleshooting after creating organization and creating a scan

vi /appdata/deque/mounts/config-server/worldspace-core/production/application.yml

====================================================================================


25. loading a database from backup

- supervisorctl stop all
- load the database (mysql import)


26. run db_upgrade.sh (only necessary on first install or reload of database)

27. start registry
28. start ecp-config-server
29. start scan-manager:
30. cat custom-rules.log make sure this starts before you start worldspace comply service
31. start worldspace:
32. on the analysis server: start the services


=================================================================================================================
# Some notes from the 6.1.4 upgrade
=================================================================================================================


For upgrades only
- stop all services
     supervisorctl stop all
- Analysis server: mkdir /etc/nginx/conf.d/
- back up directories
  Core Server only:
    /appdata/deque/components/keycloak/standalone/configuration
    /appdata/deque/mounts/
    /appdata/deque/properties/
- uninstall worldspace
   /appdata/deque/uninstall
   Remove remaining directories
- clean out the application directories
- reinstall
  Enter 21 times
  Core &amp; Analysis servers
  - Analysis server does not require database information (insert null data in the prompts)
  - Analysis server: confirm symlink exists in /etc/supervisor/conf.d -&gt; /appdata/deque/supervisord/comply.conf; supervisorctl reread; supervisorctl update
 chown worldspace:worldspace /appdata/deque -R
- restart nginx after step 3 (post installation steps)
- ** do not run first_run **
- Redis/mongo hardening
- confirm chrome version is 2.30


=======
Production redis password: &lt;&lt;&lt;1 password&gt;&gt;&gt;

Production mongo:
mongo admin --port 27018 --eval &#34;db.createUser({ user: &#39;mongodeque&#39;, pwd: &#39;&lt;&lt;&lt;1 password&gt;&gt;&gt;&#39;, roles: [ { role: &#39;dbOwner&#39;, db: &#39;admin&#39; } ] });&#34;

6.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION

6.1	Intellectual Property Indemnity.
(a)	Deque shall indemnify, defend, and hold Licensee harmless from any claim by
a third party that the Software infringes any patent, copyright, or trade secret

Press [Enter] to continue:
portions or components thereof:
(i)	Not supplied by Deque;
(ii)	Used in a manner not expressly authorized by this Agreement
(iii)	Made in accordance with Licensee&#39;s specifications;
(iv) if the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from any
customizations, modifications, alterations or changes not developed by Deque;
(v) Combined with other products (hardware or software), processes or materials
where the alleged infringement would not exist but for such combination;
(vi) Not the most current Update if infringement would have been avoided by use
of the most current Update and Deque makes the same available to Licensee;
(vii) Where Licensee continues the allegedly infringing activity after being
notified thereof and provided modifications that would have avoided the alleged
infringement; or
(viii) To the extent that the rights of any third party asserted with regard to
the Software arise out of, or are connected with, claims (whether based in
patent law or otherwise) to inventions, technologies, or methods that were in
widespread unlicensed use by third parties as of the time the Software was
delivered to, or used by, Licensee or any affiliate of Licensee.

(c)	In the event that the Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to constitute an infringement or the use of the Software is enjoined (or Deque
reasonably believes that any of the foregoing are reasonably likely to occur)
Deque may, at its option, do one of the following things.
Press [Enter] to continue:
(i)	Procure for Licensee the right to continue use of the Software;
(ii) Provide a modification to the Software so that its use becomes
non-infringing, which modification Licensee must immediately implement;
(iii) Replace the Software with software that is substantially similar in
functionality and performance; or
(iv) If none of the foregoing alternatives is reasonably available to Deque,
Deque shall refund a pro-rata portion of any fees that were pre-paid.

good, service, or software provided by Deque infringes upon, violates, or
misappropriates any right of a third party.

6.2	Indemnification Procedure.  Each party shall promptly give the other party
notice of any Claim or Loss asserted by a third party for which a party seeks
indemnity under this Agreement (each a &#34;Third Party Claim&#34;).  Deque shall have
sole control over the defense and settlement of Third Party Claims; provided,
however, that: (i) the Licensee will be entitled to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim and to employ legal advisers at its own expense to
assist in the handling of the Third Party Claim; and (ii) without the Licensee&#39;s
prior written consent: (1) no compromise or settlement may contain any finding
or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any

DEQUE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO RECORDS OR DATA, COST OF
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS
REASONABLE CONTROL.

BOTH PARTIES acknowledge and agree that the limitationS IN THIS SECTION 10 AND

under this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each party shall comply with and cause each of its employees, agents

licenses, permits, permissions and consents which may be required of it by any
Governmental Authority.

10.2	U.S. Government Users.  The Software and Documentation provided are

11.	GENERAL PROVISIONS.
11.1	Governing Law.  Except as documented in Section 11.2, this Agreement shall
be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia
(except the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, which will not apply)
without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.  The United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically
excluded from application to this Agreement.  Any suit or other action arising
out of, or related to, this Agreement may be brought only in the courts of the
Commonwealth of Virginia sitting in Fairfax County, Virginia or in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts.

11.2	Publicity.  Neither party will, without the other party&#39;s prior written
consent in each instance (a) use in advertising, publicity or marketing
communications of any kind the name or other trademarks of the other party or
Press [Enter] to continue:
any of its Affiliates, or any employee of either, or (b) represent, directly or
indirectly, that any product or service provided by a party has been approved or
endorsed by the other party or any of its Affiliates.

11.3	Trademarks.  Neither party may display or refer to the other party&#39;s
proprietary indicia, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, symbols
and/or brand names (&#34;Marks&#34;) without the advance written approval of that party,
which approval may be withheld with or without cause.  Each party agrees that it
will not assert, directly or indirectly, any right, title, or interest in, or
to, the other party&#39;s Marks or register or attempt to register any trademarks,
trade names or other proprietary indicia confusingly similar to the Marks of the
other party.  Neither party grants any rights in the Marks or in any other
trademark, trade name, service mark, business name or goodwill of the other
except as expressly permitted hereunder or by separate written agreement of the
parties.  All uses of the other party&#39;s Marks shall inure to the benefit of such
other party as owner, and the use of either party&#39;s Marks in conjunction with
the other party&#39;s Marks shall not create a unitary or composite mark.  Upon
expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, each party shall
immediately discontinue any and all use of the other party&#39;s Marks, and shall
not thereafter use any expression in connection with any business in which such
party may thereafter be engaged which, in the reasonable judgment of other party
so nearly resembles its Marks as may be likely to lead to confusion or
uncertainty on the part of the public.

supervisorctl status
- The running services will be different for each server.




Here’s the core server:
